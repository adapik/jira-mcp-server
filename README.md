## Problems This Fork Resolves

### 1. Token-Efficient Sprint Issue Listing
When working with large sprints containing many issues, the standard `list_issues_from_sprint` tool returns full JSON responses that consume significant tokens, especially when LLMs need to analyze multiple sprints or boards. This fork adds a `list_issues_from_sprint_csv` tool that returns data in a compact CSV format, dramatically reducing token usage while preserving essential information (issue key, summary, status, assignee, estimates, fix versions, and hotfix labels).

### 2. Sprint State Filtering
The original `list_sprints_from_board` tool returns all sprints (active, closed, and future) without the ability to filter. This fork adds an optional `state` parameter that allows you to fetch only active, closed, or future sprints, reducing unnecessary data transfer and making it easier to focus on relevant sprints.

**Key benefits:**
- Reduced token consumption for sprint issue queries via CSV format
- Faster response times due to smaller payloads
- More cost-effective for large-scale sprint analysis
- Targeted sprint retrieval by state (active/closed/future)
- Maintains all critical issue information in a structured format

A [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) Server for Jira.

Provides integration with Jira through MCP, allowing LLMs to interact with it.

      - `state` (optional string): Filter sprints by state (can be one of `active`, `closed`, or `future`).
      - `maxResults` (optional number, max: 100): The maximum number of results to return.
      - `startAt` (optional number): The starting index of the returned boards.

4.  `list_issues_from_sprint`: List issues from a sprint.

    - Required inputs:
      - `boardId` (string): The ID of the board.
      - `sprintId` (string): The ID of the sprint.
      - `maxResults` (optional number, max: 100): The maximum number of results to return.
      - `startAt` (optional number): The starting index of the returned boards.
      - `expand` (optional string): Expand additional information in the response. (comma separated `schema` and `names`).

5.  `create_issue`: Create an issue in Jira (Only supports Task issue type).

    - Required inputs:

      - `summary` (string): The summary/title of the issue.
      - `description` (string): The description of the issue.

## Usage examples

Some example prompts you can use to interact with Jira:

1. "Show me all Jira projects" → execute the list_projects tool to see all available projects.
2. "What Kanban boards exist in the DEV project?" → execute the list_boards tool with the DEV project key and type parameter set to "kanban".
3. "Show me all the sprints for board ID 123" → execute the list_sprints_from_board tool to see all sprints associated with board 123.
4. "Show me only the active sprint for board ID 123" → execute the list_sprints_from_board tool with state parameter set to "active" to see only active sprints.
5. "What issues are in sprint 456 on board 123?" → execute the list_issues_from_sprint tool to see all issues in sprint 456 on board 123.
6. "Show me the first 50 issues from the current sprint on the Marketing board" → first execute list_boards to find the Marketing board ID, then list_sprints_from_board with state="active" to find the active sprint, then list_issues_from_sprint with maxResults=50.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install
```

2. Configure Github Access token in `.env`:

```shell

```

3. Run locally with watch:

```shell
